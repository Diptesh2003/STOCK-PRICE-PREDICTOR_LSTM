# 📈 Stock Market Price Forecasting using LSTM (Deep Learning)

A powerful deep learning–based web application that predicts future stock prices using historical market data. Built using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks in TensorFlow/Keras, this project utilizes **Yahoo Finance API** for real-time data and is deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

> ⚡ Built for data science portfolios, academic demos, and fintech exploration. Perfect for showcasing AI in stock market forecasting.
